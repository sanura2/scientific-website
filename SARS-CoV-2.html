      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths worldwide (1). Novel vaccines have recently been issued emergency use authorization by the FDA and are being widely administered (2, 3). Early data from clinical trials suggest that these vaccines are safe and effective (4, 5); however there is still a paucity of information on how these novel mRNA vaccines elicit immune responses at the cellular and molecular level.

The humoral immune response to infection or vaccination results in two major outcomes: the production of antibodies by antibody secreting cells (ASCs) that can provide rapid serological immunity, and the generation of long-lived memory B cells capable of mounting recall responses (6, 7). If circulating antibodies fail to confer protection to a future exposure, memory B cells drive the recall response by producing new antibodies through forming new ASCs or re-entering germinal centers for additional rounds of somatic hypermutation (8, 9). In the context of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunological memory in the form of antibodies and memory B cells are durable for over 8 months post-symptom onset (10–14). However, studies on vaccinated individuals have largely focused on measuring binding and/or neutralizing antibodies as primary endpoints (15–17), and the induction of memory B cells by mRNA vaccines remains poorly understood. Although antibodies are a central component of vaccine efficacy, memory B cells may be important for long-term protection, responses to subsequent infection, and the ability to respond to emerging variant strains (18). Furthermore, it is unclear how memory B cell responses relate to serological responses for novel SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, and how memory B cell responses differ after vaccination in subjects who previously experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those who are SARS-CoV-2 naïve.</p>
        
    <h4>Abstract</h4><p>
        Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized for emergency use. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.
